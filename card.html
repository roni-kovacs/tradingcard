			<!-- your favorite animal's description goes here -->
			<p> He is a one of a kind dog, likes humans and other dogs and has very soft fur around his neck. It is rather difficult to earn his trust, he loves to snuggle though. Will fall asleep with his head hanging out of his dog bed. He doesn't really listen to his family, only when it pleases him. </p>
			<p> Overall 14/10 though, the best boy. </p>
